## KDE Color Scheme for Adwaita/adw-gtk3
Uses the color scheme set by KDE and makes it work with Adwaita.

You might want to use this if you're using a different application style than Breeze and want a more uniform look. Or you can just use this to get uniform colors on libadwaita apps by only installing for GTK4.

The 'gtk.css' files were generated from cosmic-settings, then mapped to 'colors.css' generated by KDE. There's likely more color variables that can be set in Adwaita, but I haven't looked into that yet.

### Installation
‚ùó If you have any custom gtk.css in ```~/.config/gtk-3.0``` or ```~/.config/gtk-4.0``` make sure to back it up.
```
git clone https://github.com/chikenpotpi/adwaita-kde-colors.git
cd ./adwaita-kde-colors
chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh
```
Then select an install option by typing 1, 2, or 3.

### Flatpaks
For flatpak applications you need to set a global override:
```
flatpak override --user --filesystem=xdg-config/gtk-3.0
flatpak override --user --filesystem=xdg-config/gtk-4.0
```
